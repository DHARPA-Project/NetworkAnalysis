# Network Analysis

Network analysis examines relationships among entities, such as persons, institutions, documents, or words. Navigating between multiple scales, one can use network analysis to describe and draw conclusions about relational properties of individual entities, of subsets of entities, and of entire networks. Thus, network analysis is well suited to approach research questions that focus on relationships and offers a way to integrate micro and macro perspectives.
