# Network Analysis

Network analysis examines relationships among entities, such as persons, institutions, documents, or words. Navigating between multiple scales, one can use network analysis to describe and draw conclusions about relational properties of individual entities, of subsets of entities, and of entire networks. Thus, network analysis is well suited to approach research questions that focus on relationships and offers a way to integrate micro and macro perspectives.

## 1. The DHARPA Project
While the ‘digital humanities moment’ has yielded great accomplishments and enthusiastic interdisciplinary cooperations across the humanities and between the humanities and the sciences, concerns have been raised about the little transparency in digital practices as well as the difficulty of replicating studies due to the lack of data access or standardised practices as well as unclear methodological processes (Faull et al 2016; Jakacki et al 2016, 2015; O’ Sullivan 2019). Such concerns have for instance led scholars to claim that digital humanities is still in “search of a methodology” (Dobson 2019) and the metaphor of the 'black box' has started to be used (Smith 2014) to describe the apparent loss of human agency in the digital reseach process. This could be to some extent due to the fact that traditional historical inquiry itself has in some ways been like a “Mechanical Turk,” with the decisions and interventions made by the researcher hidden from view and only the well-oiled and seemingly autonomous product on display. The [**DHARPA Project**](https://dharpa-project.github.io/) (Digital History Advanced Research Projects Accelerator) aims to reverse this trend. We want to encourage historians and digital humanities scholars to lift the lid, to show how the application of their expertise works in tandem with technology to produce knowledge, how even digitally enabled research is not a product but a process, reliant on the critical engagement of the scholar. 

In this workflow, we aim to promote a self-reflective analysis of the interaction of technology and humanities practice and we use network analysis as a case study.

## 2. Network analysis and its terminology

Almost everything can be represented in the form of a network. That does not mean that it will be useful or insightful. In the following, I will outline some basic considerations that need to be taken into account when considering network analysis as a method and introduce the basic teminology.

## 2.1 Networks are abstractions

Similarly, network graphs and the databases that are used to build them concentrate on one or a few sort of relationships between a limited set of actors, deliberately ignoring the fact that these actors necessarily have other relationships among themselves and with outsiders. Choices in "boundary specification" (whom do we observe? which ties among them? at what time(s)?) heavily constrain the sort of questions that can be analyzed by network analysis. This implies, on the one hand, that interpretations based on network data should be careful not to reify notions such as centrality or isolation, that are always relative to a choice of relations and actors observed; on the other hand, nothing prevents us to study some sorts of relations thanks to some historical sources, even if they generally do not systematically record all the sorts of relations that we would be interested in.

|    Term   |                                           Description                                          |
|:---------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   Actor   | The entity which is described by a node, e.g. a person, an institution etc.                    |
|   Broker  | A node which is positioned e.g. between two clusters and can act as a “bottleneck”             |
| Community | A set of nodes which are relatively more connected to each other than to the rest of the graph |
| ...       | ...                                                                                            |
