    "in pre WWI psychiatry networks and their publication mediums. For the one-mode network\n",

    "1902 because it is the most complete data-set and because it marks the year in which\n",
    "the first journal of psychiatry was published in Japan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Representing this data as a network was part of a broader research question about the transformation and transmission of psychiatric knowledge in the early 20th century and more specifically at the time of the Russo-Japanese war (1904-5).\n",
    "In this context, network analysis and visualisation served as a complimentary approach alongside more traditional forms of historical research and the results obtained from the digital methods served various purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the most basic level, network analysis and visualisation allowed me to get a new perspective on my sources. Ideas on psychiatric knowledge circulated in a variety of scientific journals from very different disciplines and the process of institutionalization of the discipline of psychiatry was not at the same stage in all the countries under consideration. Launching specialized journals can be considered a part of the institutionalization process and this step was taken somewhat later in Russia and Japan when compared to countries such as Germany and France. Investigating the relational properties of Russian and Japanese journals within the larger network of international psychiatric journals was one of the purposes of casting the data as a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also allowed me to use the network in an exploratory way. By browsing the journal titles by country of publication, by language, or by journal type etc … I was able to obtain a good overview of the pre-WWI publication landscape. As mentioned above, the historical network does not only contain journals purely devoted to psychiatry. Psychiatrists used to publish their work in general medicine journals (like The Lancet), in journals\n",
    "specializing in pathology (like Virchow’s Archiv), in anthropology, psychology (like the\n",
    "Annales médico psychologiques), or philosophy. The network reveals psychiatry’s tight\n",
    "bonds with neurology and pathology at the time, but it also foreshadows the emerging\n",
    "influence of psychology on the field. This historical constellation slightly differs from psychiatry's present-day position among other fields of knowledge. The network as a whole thus serves to cast light on the historical development of the discipline and to understand psychiatric knowledge production in the context of this historical constellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, more specific purpose, was to use the network as a finding aid in order to limit the reading load. The publication landscape in 20th century psychiatry is vast but not all journals were equally important to Japanese and Russian psychiatrists who had their particular reading preferences and affiliations but also followed the popular journals of the time. In this sense, network analysis helped me to identify journals in\n",
    "the network that are reviewed more often than others which might be a sign of high\n",
    "authority within the community. Similarly, it also helped to identify journals\n",
    "that served as intermediaries to bridge language barriers. \n"

    "Even before I created the databases, I had made several decisions to collect certain types of information. Since \"knowledge transmission\" was a key element in my research, I had anticipated to create a **directed network** that could represent knowledge flows. As follows from the research interest described above, I was also interested in the \"intensity of the connections\" between journals which implies a **weighted network**. Several different network types are appropriate for exploration purposes. I have used the data to create a **multi-mode network** and a **one-mode network** to explore and analyse the data in different ways. This workflow will focus on the the one-mode network type with journals as nodes. A one-mode graph is a more abstract representation of the data and is therefore generally better suited for statistical analysis. Especially the questions related to a journal's **influence** or **importance** can be well represented through different types of node centrality in a one-mode graph. This does not exclude other graph types, but limiting the network to journals-only (as opposed to multiple node types:  journals, reviewers, places, review sections etc.) can help to highlight the position of individual journals within the whole network of journals.\n",

Taking a data-centric approach, one could make this choice partly dependent on the data itself (if the relationships don't have directionality, you could never create a directed graph). However, there can be no straghtforward solution to help with this decision process if someone doesn't know what they want to do, as different approaches or a combination of them might be potentially useful. A user could be more interested in data exploration or in statistical analysis, they could be looking for patterns in flow or in structure, but these directions are not mutually exclusive and when research is understood as experimental and open-ended, then there can't be a strict guideline on how it should be done."

    "\n",
    "One of the most common operations in network analysis is to identify important nodes.\n",
    "What makes a node important depends on your network and your notion of importance.\n",
    "An important node might be a node that has the most connections. A node\n",
    "with one connection has a degree of one and degree centrality is a way for calculating a normalized value for this measure. \n",
    "Another kind of “importance” is betweenness-centrality. It indicates a node\n",
    "that lies between two distinct parts of a network (A node through which most \"shortest paths\" pass through). A node with high betweenness centrality\n",
    "can indicate that the node is a “broker” or a “gatekeeper”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some (but not all!) of the more popular centrality measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closeness centrality** is measuring how close a node is located with respect to every other node in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Degree centrality** is a measure to identify the nodes which have the most connections in the network, they are often interpreted as **hubs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Betweenness centrality** looks at all the shortest paths that pass through a particular node. It is expressed on a scale of 0 to 1 and is good at finding nodes that connect two otherwise disparate parts of a network. \n",
    "In contrast to a **hub**, this sort of node is often referred to as a **broker** because the value can be interpreted as indicating a node with an active brokering role in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvector centrality** considers if a node has many direct connections on its own, but it also considers how it is connected to other highly connected nodes. It’s calculated as a value from 0 to 1: the closer to one, the greater the centrality. In information networks, eigenvector centrality is useful for understanding which nodes can get information to many other nodes quickly. If you know a lot of well-connected people, you could spread a message very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that all these different labels (hubs, brokers) constitute **interpretations** of the obtained numbers and generate assumptions about the roles of individual actors in a network.\n",
    "Edge **weights** can significantly alter some of these centrality measures and yield very different rankings in terms of centrality. Because weights are interpreted as the \"connection strength\" in some measures and as \"distance\" (or cost) in other measures, it is important to adjust calculations according to the type of network. For example, this can imply that it might be appropriate to invert the egde weights when calculating weighted betweenness centrality in an information network. "

Depending on the data and research question, it can be very misleading to use community detection algorithms on directed graphs that have been originally developed for undirected graphs (\"It is clear that ignoring edge directionality and considering the graph as undirected is not a meaningful\n",

With people networks, these partions can help to uncover (yet unknown) common attributes among groups of people. It is up to the user to provide a useful interpretation for the communities detected with the help of the algorithm. The algorithm is only useful if the user can make sense of the communites and find the common denominators between the nodes in a community.\n",
